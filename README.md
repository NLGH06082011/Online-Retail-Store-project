Online Retail Store is a fun project created out of boredom and also to practice coding. It's basically a simple CLI program mimicking an online shopping app. Unlike the name, this program is not "online", okay?
Created with VS 2019 and supports Windows 7+. But with OS versions below 10.1511.10586 (Windows 10 version 1511 build 10586), Ansicon is needed and you have to add it to your system PATH variable.
The binary premade in GitHub Releases is dynamically linked, so you need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed.
