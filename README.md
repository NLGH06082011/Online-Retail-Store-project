Online Retail Store is a fun project created out of boredom and also to practice coding. It's basically a simple CLI program mimicking an online shopping app. Despite the name, this program is not "online", I know.
Created with Visual Studio 2019 and supports Windows 7+. However with all OSes below version 10.1511.10586 (Windows 10 version 1511 build 10586 15H2), Ansicon is needed and you have to add it to your system PATH variable.
The executable prebuilt in GitHub Releases needs Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed.
